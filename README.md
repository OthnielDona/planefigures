# planefigures
`planefigures` is a python package based on the [turtle library](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/turtle.html). It takes the pain out of drawing plain shapes.

## Installation
```bash
pip install planefigures
```
Python 3 is supported.

## How to use
```python
from figures import polygon

# polygon(sides, length)
polygon(4, 100)
```

## Road map
At this stage, only [regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon) are supported. The aim however, is to support regular as well as irregular shapes.
